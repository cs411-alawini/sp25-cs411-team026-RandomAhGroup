## Project Summary

The Smart Travel Planner is a web application designed to help users efficiently plan their trips by generating personalized itineraries based on their travel destinations and interests. Users will input their travel location, duration of stay, and personal preferences, such as food, culture, nature, and activities. The application will then suggest a structured itinerary, organizing attractions and activities in an optimal sequence based on proximity, ratings, and user interests.
This project aims to provide an intelligent travel planning experience that minimizes the time spent on research while maximizing user satisfaction. Unlike traditional itinerary planners, which require users to manually search for attractions and organize them, our system automates this process using data-driven recommendations and intelligent routing.
